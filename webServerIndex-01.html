    <p>Here is some text formated <br>
    <br>
    The Most Horrible X-Mas Ever (Transcript)<br>
    Pan to Earth as seen from space. 'EARTH: TWO MILLION YEARS IN<br> 
    THE FUTURE' types out on screen. Fade in to a bedroom where a<br> 
    group of young children sit in front of Mr. Sludgy, a robotic<br> 
    snowman.<br> 
    <br>
    Mr. Sludgey (singing): So raise the shields and have some joy, <br>
    'cause Christmas time is heeere!<br>
    <br>
    The children jump up and down with glee and cheer.<br>
    Child: That was great, Mr. Sludgy! Now, will you tell us the <br>
    story of the most horrible Christmas ever?<br>
    <br>
    r. Sludgy laughs.<br>
    Mr. Sludgy: No, little girl. No I won't.<br>
    A electric fizzling noise comes from inside Mr. Sludgy.<br>
    Mr. Sludgy: Wait... yes, I will! Well, it's a little hazy, but <br>
    it all started 2 million years ago...<br>
    Fade in to the city 2 million years ago. It is snowing.<br>
    Mr. Sludgy (v.o.): ...with a little green nuclear mole, named <br>
    <br>
    Zim!<br>
    Some carolers sing within a giant snow globe. They sing the <br>
    word 'blah' over and over to the tune of 'Jingle Bells.' A few <br>
    people are gathered across the street, looking at something.<br>
    Mr. Sludgy (v.o.): Now, Zim hated humans more than anything!<br>
    <br>
    The crowd leaves, revealing that they were standing in front of <br>
    Zim, GIR, and MiniMoose. Zim wears a strange new human <br>
    disguise, GIR wears his dog suit, and MiniMoose holds a <br>
    collection plate on his head. Zim has a small animal stuck to <br>
    his side. GIR eats snow from a pile on the ground.<br>
    <br>
    Zim: Stink, stink, stink, stiiinking humaaans!!<br>
    <br>
    The frame freezes and a comic panel showing Mr. Sludgy floats by.<br>
    Mr. Sludgy: But he didn't know much about Christmas now, did he?<br>
